# Program-to-print-all-Prime-Numbers-in-an-Interval
This Python script finds and prints all prime numbers within a given range specified by the user.
## Code Explanation
`lower = int(input("Enter the Lower limit : "))`: Allows the user to input an integer value for the lower limit.
 `upper = int(input("Enter the Upper limit : "))`: Allows the user to input an integer value for the upper limit.
The script then iterates through the range of numbers from the lower limit to the upper limit, checking each number for primality using a nested loop.
Prime numbers are printed to the console as they are found.
